description:
 This check monitors the Windows Defender health on Windows systems. It processes
 data collected by the {ms_win_defender.ps1} agent plugin.

 The check evaluates the running mode, enabled protection features, scan ages,
 and signature status. By default, it expects Windows Defender to run in
 {Normal} mode with all core protection features enabled.

 You can configure which running mode is expected (Normal, Passive Mode, EDR Block
 Mode, SxS Passive Mode, or Disabled), which protection features must be enabled,
 and set thresholds for quick scan and full scan ages.
 The check triggers configurable states for outdated signatures (default: WARNING),
 configurable {WARN} and {CRIT} states for scan age thresholds, and {CRIT} state
 for disabled required features or unexpected running mode.

 Protection features include Antimalware Service, Antispyware Engine, Antivirus
 Engine, Behavior Monitoring, IOAV Protection, Network Protection, On-Access
 Protection, Real-time Protection, and Tamper Protection.

 You must deploy the {ms_win_defender.ps1} agent plugin to Windows hosts
 to collect Windows Defender status information.

discovery:
 One service named {Windows Defender health} is created on each Windows host where
 the agent plugin is deployed.
